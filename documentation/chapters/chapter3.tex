\chapter{System Analysis}

\section{System Requirements}
A requirement is simply a statement of what the system must do or what characteristics
it needs to have. During a systems development project, requirements will be created
that describe what the business needs (business requirements), what the users
need to do (user requirements), what the software should do (functional requirements),
characteristics the system should have (nonfunctional requirements), and how
the system should be built (system requirements).

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
Functional requirements are the specifications of the productâ€™s functions
(features). In another words, functional requirements define what precisely a
software must do and how the system must respond to inputs. Functional
requirements define the software's goals, meaning that the software will not work if
these requirements are not met.

\begin{enumerate}
    \customitem{Authentication}
        \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
            \item The system will allow users to create an account.
            \item The system must validate users credentials to login.
            \item Users should have the ability to reset their passwords in case of forgotten credentials. 
        \end{enumerate}
    \customitem{Enroll Courses}
        \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
            \item Students can enroll courses and see course content
              We will extend this to enroll paid course wit credit card, debit card etc. in the future.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Course Managment} \hfill
        \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
            \item Instructors can create a course and upload to our website.
            \item Instructors can upload various types of course content, including text, multimedia, and documents.
            \item Only authorized instructors should have the ability to modify or update course content.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
Non-functional Requirements define system attributes such as security,
reliability, performance, maintainability, scalability, and usability. They serve as
constraints or restrictions on the design of the system across the different backlogs.
Also known as system qualities, non-functional requirements are just as critical as
functional requirements. They ensure the usability and effectiveness of the entire
system. They specify criteria that judge the operation of a system, rather than specific
behaviors.

\begin{itemize}
    \customitem{Performance} \vspace{0.2cm} \\
        The application should be able to handle large numbers of concurrent users.  
    \customitem{Security} \vspace{0.2cm} \\
        The application should protect user data from
        unauthorized access or theft.
    \customitem{Scalability} \vspace{0.2cm} \\
        The application should be able to handle an increasing number of users and services.
    \customitem{User-friendliness} \vspace{0.2cm} \\
        The application should be easy to use and navigate, with
        clear instructions and explanations of the analysis process.
    \customitem{Privacy} \vspace{0.2cm} \\
        The application should have a clear privacy policy and
        should not retain user data
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Exploring Trade-offs Architectures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sequence to sequence models (LSTM-GRU-RNN):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Difficulty in Incorporating Domain Knowledge 
        \item Limited Interpretability
        \item Handling Varied Output Lengths
    \end{itemize}
    \item Encoder-Decoder Transformer:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Transformer architecture, with self-attention mechanisms, has been widely used in Seq2Seq tasks.
        \item It does come with some potential disadvantages, including high training costs.
        \item Alternative way Fine-Tuning and Transfer Learning.
    \end{itemize}

The motivation behind designing a large language model with adaptive layers lies in the pursuit of creating a model that can efficiently and effectively adapt to the complexities and nuances of different datasets and tasks

\subsection{Flexibility Across Diverse Tasks:}

Adaptive layers enhance the model's flexibility to handle various natural language processing tasks. Whether it's text classification, language translation, sentiment analysis, or any other task, the adaptive layers allow the model to dynamically adjust its parameters based on the specific requirements of each task.

\subsection{Optimizing for Different Data Distributions:}

Different datasets may exhibit varying data distributions and characteristics. Adaptive layers provide a mechanism for the model to adapt its learning rates or normalization parameters dynamically, optimizing its performance for the specific patterns present in the data.



\subsection{Enhanced Convergence and Training Speed:}

Adaptive learning rate methods contribute to faster convergence during training. By adapting learning rates for individual parameters, the model can converge more quickly, leading to reduced training times and improved overall efficiency.
\section{Use Case Analysis}
A Use Case is a type of behavioral representation that shows the interactions
between a system and its users, or actors. It is used to represent and model the
functionality of a system. The main purpose of a use case diagram is to capture
the functional requirements of a system. 
\\ \\ \\
\textbf{There are two formats to represent use cases:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use case diagram.
    \item Use case specifications or scenario in textual format.
\end{enumerate}
